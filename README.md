This is my resume project. The resume itself is located at jonathansilverstein.info .
The resume is based off a bootstrap template I found on the internet.
I then added a PHP backend to that bootstrap template that stored the necessary information, in addition to JavaScript which allows you to modified the information stored.
I'm storing a number of other resumes, to demonstrate the flexibility of the template, as well as allow other people to modify them.
If you like what you see here, or at jonathansilverstein.info, feel free to email me if you would like a web developer.
